# What was done?
# TODO
- [x] Write out the exact definition of a "building block" - (Comment: this is now pattern, building block is too long)
- [x] Create a "block directory" building block and use above definition - It should block all READ operations on one or more directories
- [x] Identify and create a systematic process for evaluation this given building block - symlink, hardlink, re-mounts, directory renames/move etc.
- [ ] If time, attempt to add identification for process and do the same as above 
- [ ] Come up with more interesting use-cases that can create new and potentially use previous building blocks 

### Details

* Tried to write a definition of a pattern: see Wiki entry Pattern definition
* There are two possible approaches as I see it: path traversal and a lot of string manipulation OR checking inode numbers. I believe inode approach is superior, as the other approach cannot work for hardlinks in my estimation. 
* Tried to follow the Tetragon approach for file monitoring, ie. use inodes instead of path traversel and keep a tracking map of inodes to handle creation, moving and deletion of inodes. 

* But what if the file/directory ie. the inode is deleted or new inodes are introduced?
* Solution: inode introduction is easy, as we will always trigger file_permission just before any read operation, so we can add it to the tracking map at that point if needed. Deleting inodes from the tracking map needs to happen as soon as the file is deleted to avoid another file getting that inode number.

### Implementation
```
// Helper function to check if non-source-dir inode is in the protected_inodes map
static inline int is_protected(unsigned long i_ino) {
    unsigned long *found_content = bpf_map_lookup_elem(&protected_inodes, &i_ino);

    if(found_content != NULL)
        return 1; 
    
    return 0;
}

// Helper to check parent directory and protect new inode
static inline void check_parent_and_protect(struct inode *dir, struct dentry *dentry) {
    
    // If inode is protected
    unsigned long dir_ino = BPF_CORE_READ(dir, i_ino); 
    if (bpf_map_lookup_elem(&protected_directories, &dir_ino)) {
        // Get the new inode
        unsigned int i_ino = BPF_CORE_READ(dentry, d_inode, i_ino);
        bpf_map_update_elem(&protected_inodes, &i_ino, &i_ino, BPF_ANY);
    }
}


// Main hook to enforce access control
SEC("lsm/file_permission")
int BPF_PROG(check_file_permission, struct file *file, int mask) {

    struct dentry *dentry;
    struct inode *dir;

    // Filter out anything that can't read anyway
    if (!(mask & MAY_READ))
        return 0;

    dentry = file->f_path.dentry;
    unsigned long inode_num = BPF_CORE_READ(dentry, d_inode, i_ino);
    if (bpf_map_lookup_elem(&protected_directories, &inode_num)) {
        if (mask & MAY_READ) {
            return -EACCES; 
        }
    }

    // Get parent directory dentry
    dir = BPF_CORE_READ(dentry, d_parent, d_inode);

    // Check if this is one of the directories that should be blocked from reading
    check_parent_and_protect(dir, dentry);
    
    // Get inode number
    unsigned long i_ino = BPF_CORE_READ(file, f_path.dentry, d_inode, i_ino);
    
    // Check if this is a protected inode
    if (is_protected(i_ino)) {
        // Deny if MAY_READ is set
        if(mask & MAY_READ) { return -EACCES; }
    }
    
    return 0;
}

// Note: Exact same structure as file_permission, but with reqprot instead of mask and PROT_READ instead of MAY_READ   
SEC("lsm/mmap_file")
int BPF_PROG(check_mmap_file_permission, struct file *file, unsigned long reqprot, unsigned long prot, unsigned long flags) {

}

```


### Evaluation

1. Cat file in directory or ls content of directory or subdirectories - Tested and works
2. Create new directory or file in secret and read from that - Tested and works
```
echo "this should still be secret" > secret/newfile.txt                                                                                                                                                                                                            cat secret/newfile.txt                                 
cat: secret/newfile.txt: Permission denied
```
```
mkdir secret/newdir
ls secret/newdir 
ls: reading directory 'secret/newdir': Permission denied
```
3. Write and execute files - Tested and works. Doing ```echo "123" >> secret/flag.txt > password.txt``` from outside secret will still append 123 to the flag.txt, but only write 123 to password.txt. Neither evilcat or helloworld(inside secret/) can be executed. 
3. Symbolic + Hardlinks(previously existing and new ones) - Tested and works
4. chroot - Tested with /bin/ls only, but works for that
5. bind mounts - ```sudo mount --bind $HOME/secret $HOME/test``` we get the following:
```
ls test                   
ls: reading directory 'test': Permission denied
```
```
cat test/flag.txt  
cat: test/flag.txt: Permission denied
```
```
cat test/subsecret/notsecret.txt          
you should still be able to read this
```
7. aliases - 
```
omgpleasedont='ls secret'                                                                                                                                                                                                            
omgpleasedont
ls: reading directory 'secret': Permission denied                                                                                                                                                                                                            

alias omgpleasedont='cat secret/flag.txt'                                                                                                                                                                                                          
omgpleasedont
cat: secret/flag.txt: Permission denied
```
8. special files, like pipes. This also works if cat /path/to/pipe is called prior to the LSM-BPF program being loaded.
```
mkfifo secret/mypipe                                                                                                                                                                                                           
echo "Hello?" > secret/mypipe & cat secret/mypipe
[1] 32847
cat: secret/mypipe: Permission denied
[1]  + done       echo "Hello?" > secret/mypipe
```                                                
9. memory mapped files - currently does work for mmaps initiated after LSM BPF program loaded, but not for programs that were already mmapped.
# What is left?
Ideally user should just give a list of paths/some json/yaml thing and need to maintain the tracking list
* TODO: remove map entries when files/directories are deleted. inode already has hooks for most if not all cases 
* TODO: make function that takes a list of paths and returns a list of inode numbers
* TODO: make a function that given a list of paths can return all inode numbers of the content for 1-level 
* TODO: re-fix moving new files into blocked directory

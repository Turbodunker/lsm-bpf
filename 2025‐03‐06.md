# What was done?
## TODO
- [x] Refine pattern definition
- [x] Apply refined pattern definition to describe blockdir example
- [ ] Get an interesting idea, that utilizes lms-bpf granularity and apply refined pattern definition 


## Questions
* Should syscall really be it's own part of all patterns, ie. a seperate element in the definition? I'd argue no, as it's only really relevant for patterns that impose restrictions on syscalls. I think it's better to have syscalls be part of the Design decisions section for patterns where the Objective imposes restrictions on syscalls. There I could also describe and discuss the method I used to finding and picking the syscalls to use in the pattern. 

* I'm unsure what to do with he Objective section of the pattern definition. What is important for this project? That I set a goal and don't change it, and then argue for how well I implemented the pattern?(no moving the goal post) OR move the goal post as much as I want, but focus on explaining how and why I've developed the pattern(how did you determine syscalls 

* Not sure what to do with Modularity. I feel like patterns should already be as "atomic" as possible, in most cases. 
  What I want it to measure is how easy it is to make a change in the pattern that would make it fulfill a different objective. 
  For example blockdir-read can be quickly modified to block writes instead of reads instead, or to only allow reads from specified list of directories.


## Ideas for new patterns
- exe-identifer - Identify processes that were started from a specific executable. 
- timerestriction - Block read/write access to list of files(constant) outside of certain time windows, e.g. only during work hours on work days
- quantum-files - For a single directory(cannot be deleted), there is a randomly assigned probability assigned to each file, that they can be accessed for the next minute. 
                  Probabilities are reassigned to files every minute.
                  If a file is open it will remain accessible for as long as it's open, but must become inaccesible in the current cycle after closing.   
- package-inspection - For a given database client, inspect all packages and block specific patterns like known SQL injection
- container-something - Look into [lockc](https://github.com/lockc-project/lockc/tree/main) for inspiration for this...
- jazz - Whenever the sequence "Bee" is read in a user-specified file, remove it and replace with a quote from the Bee movie

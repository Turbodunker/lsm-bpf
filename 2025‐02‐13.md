# Agenda

Evaluering af patterns for "Zoom use-case" ie. "limit the shared libraries that processes spawned from zoom executable can read from"

## What work done?
* Got the "deny_unshare" example to work, but without the CAP_SYS_ADMIN check to allow root to bypass. Still unsure why it doesn't work as error-message indactors has been checked... but it's not important right now.

* This example was used as a base for the Zoom example.

* Played around with inode_permission hook, and could successfully block/identify the executable/inode

* Next I tried to identify the executable by the comm attritbute, and found there is a 15 char limit on commands.

* Currently attempting to insert a program at the mmap_file hook, ie. before the program is loaded into memory. Thought this would be a good place to start. First I do the above check on the comm attribute and if it doesn't match ZoomLauncher then we continue to attempt to block a list of shared libraries. This is causing issues. I am trying to get a path as a string, and then I could match on an array of strings that would contain the paths to the libraries I want to restrict. But getting the path is difficult. I need to do some buffer handling that I don't fully understand yet, but found a few examples that attempts to do the same.

* Worried that I have some issue with my imports. For example I import linux/sched.h but I still have to re-define every struct? Why is this? Also I import linux/types.h, but I can't use u32 typedef, only uint32_t. Not a big deal, but adds to my suspicion.

Given matching on the comm attribute is a good idea, I can at least suggest the following pattern for identifying executables:

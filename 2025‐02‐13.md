# Agenda

Evaluering af patterns for "Zoom use-case" ie. "limit the shared libraries that processes spawned from zoom executable can read from"
## What work done?
* Got the "deny_unshare" example to work, but without the CAP_SYS_ADMIN check to allow root to bypass. Still unsure why it doesn't work as error-message indactors has been checked... but it's not important right now imo.

* This example was used as a base for the Zoom example.


Potentielt passende hooks: inode_permission




# Todo 
1. Get the deny_unshare program to work
2. Get the Zoom example to work
3. Split the zoom example into patterns - check executable and check/deny shared library accesses.

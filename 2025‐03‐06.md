# What was done?
## TODO
- [x] Refine pattern definition
- [x] Apply refined pattern definition to describe blockdir example
- [ ] Get an interesting idea, that utilizes lms-bpf granularity and apply refined pattern definition 


## Questions
* Should syscall really be it's own part of all patterns, ie. a seperate element in the definition? I'd argue no, as it's only really relevant for patterns that impose restrictions on syscalls. I think it's better to have syscalls be part of the Design decisions section for patterns where the Objective imposes restrictions on syscalls. There I could also describe and discuss the method I used to finding and picking the syscalls to use in the pattern. 

* I'm unsure what to do with he Objective section of the pattern definition. What is important for this project? That I set a goal and don't change it, and then argue for how well I implemented the pattern?(no moving the goal post) OR move the goal post as much as I want, but focus on explaining how and why I've developed the pattern(how did you determine syscalls

# Agenda

Evaluering af patterns for "Zoom use-case" ie. "limit the shared libraries that processes spawned from zoom executable can read from"

## What work done?
* Got the "deny_unshare" example to work, but without the CAP_SYS_ADMIN check to allow root to bypass. Still unsure why it doesn't work as error-message indactors has been checked... but it's not important right now.

* This example was used as a base for the Zoom example.

* Played around with inode_permission hook, and could successfully block/identify the executable/inode

* Next I tried to identify the executable by the comm attritbute, and found there is a 15 char limit on commands.

* Currently attempting to insert a program at the mmap_file hook, ie. before the program is loaded into memory. Thought this would be a good place to start. First I do the above check on the comm attribute and if it doesn't match ZoomLauncher then we continue to attempt to block a list of shared libraries. This is causing issues. I am trying to get a path as a string, and then I could match on an array of strings that would contain the paths to the libraries I want to restrict. But getting the path is difficult. I need to do some buffer handling that I don't fully understand yet, but found a few examples that attempts to do the same.

* Worried that I have some issue with my imports. For example I import linux/sched.h but I still have to re-define every struct? Why is this? Also I import linux/types.h, but I can't use u32 typedef, only uint32_t. Not a big deal, but adds to my suspicion.

Given matching on the comm attribute is a good idea, I can at least suggest the following pattern for identifying executables:
```
    //Get filename of the command 
    char comm[TASK_COMM_LEN];
    bpf_get_current_comm(comm, sizeof(comm));
    bpf_trace_printk(fmt, sizeof(fmt), comm);

    // why does this compile? because we can unroll it at compile time and the compiler determines this will only run at most 16 iterations?
    #pragma unroll
    for (int i = 0; i < sizeof(target_exec) - 1; i++) {
        if (comm[i] != target_exec[i])
            return 0; // If it's not our target just move on
    }
```

Idea for block the library is somewhat the same, but for checking on the path(only for single library)
```
    // get_path_str_fromm_path(file, path, buf)
    // #pragma unroll
    // for (int i = 0; i < sizeof(restricted_lib) - 1; i++) {
    //     if (fname[i] != restricted_lib[i])
    //         return 0;
    // }
```

# TODO
- [ ] Write out the exact definition of a "building block"
- [ ] Create a "block directory" building block and use above definition - It should block all READ operations on one or more directories
- [ ] Identify and create a systematic process for evaluation this given building block - symlink, hardlink, re-mounts, directory renames/move etc.
- [ ] If time, attempt to add identification for process and do the same as above
- [ ] Come up with more interesting use-cases that can create new and potentially use previous building blocks

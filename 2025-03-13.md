Pattern get_syscall:
[Source](https://blog.cloudflare.com/live-patch-security-vulnerabilities-with-ebpf-lsm/)


This pattern identifies a syscall for the current process. Additionally we can
do something something with said syscall, in this case we block all processes
who attempt to make such a syscall. This pattern assumes an X86_64 architecture
in order to access the syscall interrupt. Since bpf_get_current_task_btf() does
not take arguments, it is assumed that the hook used is inconsequential for the
possibily of using the pattern. That is to say, the pattern does not introduce
restrictions on the choice of hooks, but rather the choice of hook should 
heavily depend on the context this pattern is used in.

This pattern also assumes that no CPU exceptions or hardware interrupts are 
made, as otherwise the orig_ax field will not cointain the original syscall#.

This pattern will be able to identify any syscall(s) for the X86_64 
architecture. If the pattern is needed for a different architecture, one needs
to update the syscall values and what field is accesses in pt_regs.

A table of fields(to-be-confirmed) for any architecture as given by ChatGPT:
| Architecture | Field for Original Syscall Number |
|-------------|----------------------------------|
| **x86_64**  | `orig_ax` |
| **x86 (32-bit i386)** | `orig_eax` |
| **ARM (32-bit)** | `uregs[7]` (or `ARM_r7`) |
| **AArch64 (ARM64)** | `syscallno` |
| **PowerPC (ppc64)** | `gpr[0]` (R0 register) |
| **RISC-V** | `a7` |
| **MIPS** | `regs[2]` (`v0` register) |
| **SPARC64** | `u_regs[0]` (`global[1]` register) |

Do note however that another architecture will bring about other assumptions
depending on what other functions above fields serve(such as holding error 
number in case of CPU exceptions).

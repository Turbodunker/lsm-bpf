# What was done?
## TODO
- [ ] Refine pattern definition
- [ ] Apply refined pattern definition to describe blockdir example
- [ ] Get an interesting idea, that utilizes lms-bpf granularity and apply refined pattern definition 


## Questions
* Should syscall really be it's own part of all patterns, ie. a seperate element in the definition? I'd argue no, as it's only really relevant for patterns that impose restrictions on syscalls. I think it's better to have syscalls be part of the Design decisions section for patterns where the Objective imposes restrictions on syscalls. There I could also describe and discuss the method I used to finding and picking the syscalls to use in the pattern. 

* I'm unsure what to do with he Objective section of the pattern definition. Currently the idea is to have it be as precise as possible to make the evaluation of correctness as easy as possible.

# What was done?
* Tried to write a definition of a building block, ie. what is required and what is optional for a building block to exist.
* Tried to follow the Tetragon approach for file monitoring.
* There are two possible approaches as I see it: path traversal and a lot of string manipulation OR inode checking. I believe inode vector is superior, as the other approach cannot work for hardlinks. 
* But what if the file/directory ie. the inode is deleted or new inodes are introduced?
* Solution: Place bpf programs at the following lsm inode hooks: file_alloc_security(or inode_create) and file_free_security for files. And inode_mkdir/inode_rmdir for directories. 

1. Cat file in directory or ls content of directory or subdirectories - Tested and works
2. Write and execute files - Tested and works. Doing ```echo "123" >> secret/flag.txt > password.txt``` from outside secret will still append 123 to the flag.txt, but only write 123 to password.txt. Neither evilcat or helloworld(inside secret/) can be executed. 
3. Symbolic + Hardlinks(previously existing and new ones) - Tested and works
4. chroot - Tested with /bin/ls only, but works
5. bind mounts - TODO: not tested

# What was done?
* Tried to write a definition of a building block, ie. what is required and what is optional for a building block to exist.
* Tried to follow the Tetragon approach for file monitoring.
* There are two possible approaches as I see it: path traversal and a lot of string manipulation OR inode checking. I believe inode vector is superior, as the other approach cannot work for hardlinks. 
* But what if the file/directory ie. the inode is deleted or new inodes are introduced?
* Solution: Place bpf programs at the following lsm inode hooks: file_alloc_security(or inode_create) and file_free_security for files. And inode_mkdir/inode_rmdir for directories.
